Custom String Converter

2/29 spent time looking up arrays, going over differences in lists/arrays
3/1 more time on arrays and lists, iterating through them, accessing info inside them, 
    writing what I wanted from them to the console, etc..
	pretty much that was everything I was looked up and went over in various places 
	throughout the entire day.
